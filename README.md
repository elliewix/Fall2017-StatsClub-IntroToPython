# Intro to Python: Illini Statistics Club (Fall 2017)

## Premis

R is a powerful tool for statistics, data anasysis, and data visualization, and can be used for a wide variety of data processing tasks.  Unfortunately, you may end up working on a team that only uses Python, need to use a tool that is only in Python, or just have a task too unwieldy for you to accomplish in R.

No matter the reason, the current state of data science requires that we can be functional in both R and Python.  Many blog posts out there work hard to try and compare the two, and attempt to pick a winner.  Analysis of tools like StackOverflow and GitHub are trying to measure the growth of each over time, but no matter who might be the winner of the day you'll need to know both to some level.

## What we'll cover here

This will be more of a tour of python and going through an example program.

1. What is Python and a bit of the history
2. The python ecosystem and how to install things
3. Stepping through a data processing task

This is not meant to be the only python expoluse that you need to get started, but instead to be a jumping off point to help you get started or be more comfortable if you are put into a sudden position of using python.
